  We are going to design a Product Catalog + Cart Page with 2 sections:
    - The Product Catalog Component, which contains information for each product
    
    - The Cart Component, which contains:
      - how many of the product I want, total products, total price
      - AddProduct(), IncreaseQuantity(), DecreaseQuantity()

    price: 3.40,
    quantity: 1
  }

const cartWithSeveralItems = [
  {
    id: "003",
